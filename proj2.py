# DESCRIPTION
# The program reads the input data of sonar_all_data_2.csv and outputs the
# maximum testing accuracy 88.89 % at 4 components of PCA. The program split
# the input data into training (70%) and testing sets (30%) with suffling.
# After standardizing the data, both sets were transformed. With iterations,
# the number of components was applied from 1 to 60 for reducing number of
# features and noise. By using GridSearch, hyperparameters were tuned and
# optimized with a Muli-Layer Perceptron neural networks.
#
# By plotting accuracy as a function of number of accuracy, the maximum accuracy
# was found at optimal number of components. The maximum testing accuracy was
# 88.89 % at 4 components of PCA. The reason why this model was chosen is to
# predict mines more accurately. The plot results the best as 94% accuracy with
# the seed value 12154995756 of random state whereas the best was 89% accuracy
# with a seed2 value 12155995756. However, the model with seed2 value was chosen
# to detect and classify mines more accurately. The following confusion matrix
# shows that the model tuned with seed1 predicted 37 mines out of 39 (95%
# accuracy in detecting mines and overall 94% accuracy) and 22 rocks out of 24
# and the model tuned with seed2 predicted 31 mines out of 32 (97% accuracy in
# detecting mines and overall 89% accuracy). Thus, I chose the second model which
# achieved 97% accuracy in detecting mines at 4 components of PCA even though its
# overall accuracy was 89%.

# Function to plot a confusion matrix with annotations.
# Inputs:
#   y_true - actual label of the data, with shape (n samples)
#   y_pred - predicted label of the data, with shape (n samples)
#   filename - filename of figure file to save as a png file.
#   labels - string array as class labels in the confusion matrix,
#            with shape (n classes).
#   ymap - dict: any -> string, length == nclass.
#          if not None, map the labels & ys to more understandable strings.
#          Caution: original y_true, y_pred and labels must align.
#   figsize - the size of the figure for the plot.
# Outputs:
#    correlations are printed to the screen
